# Algorithm and Datastructures
---
## Introduction
In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output.

## Data structures
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:
- Linear data structure (Array, Stack, Queue. Linked List)
- Non-linear data structure (Graph, Trees)

 ```python
 def prova(n):
     m = 0
     for i in range(21):
         return i
 ```

 ### Queue
 ### Stack
 ### Hash tables
